# Amplitude and Ring Modulation

**Exploring Sidebands, Sum/Difference Tones, and DC Offset**

---

## Introduction and Overview

- Understand the fundamental principles of amplitude modulation (AM) and ring modulation (RM).
- Identify and describe sidebands and sum/difference tones in the context of AM and RM.
- Implement AM and RM using Max/MSP.
- Identify AM and RM in musical examples. 
- Explain the causes and effects of DC offset in audio signals.

- Remember, the frequency is the number of cycles per second of the waveform, and the amplitude is the waveform height. Each corresponds to pitch and volume.

**Show basic signal generation example in Max. Create cycle, saw, tri, rect, click, and noise. Connect to a selector to switch between waveforms.**

- Modulation is when one signal changes another signal in some way. In the image, the water droplet is causing ripples in the water (modulating the water). The amplitude of the ripples is due to the force of the water drop. 
- In audio, typically modulation is caused when one oscillator or noise waveform changes the amplitude, frequency, or phase of another waveform.
- This can be done in many ways, such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), ring modulation (RM), and phase modulation (PM).
- An example of tremolo can be seen in the Learning Synths link above.
